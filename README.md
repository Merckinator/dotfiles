# dotfiles
Configuration files for various tools with which I have been experimenting.

TODO: Write scripts or console commands to copy these config files back-and-forth.

`cp c:/Users/jmerc/.wezterm.lua c:/Users/jmerc/Documents/repos/dotfiles/.wezterm.lua`


## Terminals

- WezTerm - wezterm.org - has built-in pane support

  - Alacritty - alacritty.org


## Shells

- Nushell - www.nushell.sh

  - Xonsh - xon.sh - doesn't have, e.g. `ls` built-in; defers to system


## Editors

- Helix - helix-editor.com - a vim-like, modal editor where it's movement -> action
  - no plug-in system yet (2/9/2025), so AI integration would have to be setup via lsp language server

- Neovim - lazyvim.org - a distribution with tons of features already configured

- VS Code - has alright vim-bindings and custom hotkey support
